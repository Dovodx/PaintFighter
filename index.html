        <div class='introduction'>
            Fight to your badly-drawn death with amazing characters like
            Dr. Tentacle, Sad Sword, Liquid, and Sanic teh Hegehog!<br/>
            The game is currently in development with more characters and levels planned!<br/>
            This website is also a work in progress.

                This is a multiplayer fighting game that is, essentially, an "mspaint" parody of Super Smash Bros.
                The game supports up to four players both locally and online.
                You can even have more than one player on the same computer when playing online!

                my friends and I for now.

                        AI players are, as far as I'm concerned, ready for their first outing in
                        the next update. I'm going to add some more content in first, then y'all

                        <br>THE TIME HAS COME AND SO HAVE I. With DMC4 quoting out of the way,
                        here's the big list of changes in this update!<br><br>
                        New Features and Balance Changes:
                        <br>✔Added a setting to determine if the top kill boundary should kill regardless of hurt state, applied it to Sanic Land so that the spikes at the top kill if one jumps too high
                        <br>✔Gave Dr. Tentacle more jump height
                        <br>✔Added a new character, Rock Lobster
                        <br>✔Added another new character, Thundersnow
                        <br>✔Moved character controls to a generic script. This reduces redundant code and paves the way for AI players.
                        <br>✔Added crouching for the lols
                        <br>✔Added a visual effect for invincibility
                        <br>✔Made changing the number of lives functional
                        <br>✔Made a new level select screen (functional but not finished)
                        <br>✔Redoing the HUD (some work has been done, leaving it for now)
                        <br>✔Added a new level, Westopolis
                        <br>✔Touched up Snowy Summit and Desktop 2000
                        <br>✔Buffed the DREADED GUITAR
                        <br>✔Re-added the vortex knockback option (grabs remain the same, unity doesn’t work)
                        <br>✔Created a manual spawn point system for level-specific spawning and placed spawn points in most levels
                        <br>✔Added fappy tails
                        <br>[after some internal testing, the following changes were made]
                        <br>✔Nerfed stupid fucking Thundersnow
                        <br>✔Made his hitboxes end properly
                        <br>✔Fixed Rock Lobster’s GN side, buffed GN down, buffed US speed, little more air speed
                        <br>✔Sad Sword slowed his ass down
                        <br>✔Buffed Sad Sword’s US distance and nerfed GN neutral
                        <br>✔Made fappy tails’ hitbox a little bit smaller
                        <br>✔Gave Liquid some buffs to his attacks, a little more mass
                        <br>✔Increased gravity and updated characters to work as intended
                        <br>✔All characters have had some hitstun changes, generally increased hitstun overall
                        <br>✔Added Shaydoh
                        <br>✔Add Beowulf
                        <br>✔Add another new level (Party Bus)
                        <br>✔Added music for all the levels
                        <br>✔Made the best trailer ever
                        <br><br>
                        As for bugs:
                        <br>(?)A bug was found while I was testing the game with Jesse in which you could turn around while being hit and your hitbox would stay out for 1 frame, letting you hit the opponent back. This bug might have been fixed. Testing is needed.
                        <br>✔Fixed Sad Sword and Dr. Tentacle’s crazy GN neutrals, lots of damage and hitstun with too little knockback
                        <br>✔Sad Sword’s orb wasn’t working when used twice in a row
                        <br>✔Grab cooldown meters weren’t drawing in front of level platforms (the sprite on each character had to be changed to have a higher order in the layer)
                        <br>✔RGB Land needed the options menu
                        <br>✔Sad Sword could get stuck on part of the Aeroplane with his AN, his AN now has a condition to cancel if he has stopped moving
                        <br>✔Fixed a problem with the grab meter’s cap, of course Rock Lobster was the only cause
                        <br>✔Sanic could jump just as his US ended if he started it on the ground
                        <br>✔Fixed the camera not knowing left from right boundaries and re-coded the maximum size
                        <br>✔Fixed an issue that was preventing Sad Sword from getting respawn invincibility
                        <br>✔Fixed a camping exploit that allowed Sad Sword to teleport inside of Snowy Summit and The Aeroplane
                        <br>✔Level loading was very finicky, games could end prematurely if a second player didn’t load fast enough
                        <br>✔fappy tails had a lot of trouble building speed on clients
                        <br><br>
                        I TOLD YOU THIS WAS A BIG UPDATE! The game still has some really important things that need
                        to be added in before it's ready for a public release. Proper menus, offline multiplayer that
                        you can just jump into, configurable controls, AI players, and some sort of singleplayer mode
                        with co-op immediately jump to mind. As big as this update may have been to me, this game has
                        much further to go. As you can probably tell, most of the time was spent adding these 5 new
                        characters. I had been wanting to expand the cast more since new characters were all my friends
                        would get excited about, generally speaking. So how do ya like THEM apples!? Anyway, I'll wait
                        until I've tested this new update with my friends before I decide for sure what the next update
                        will focus on. I may just do AI players and see how that works out, as this game is really in
                        need of some kind of co-op mode, but the menus would need updating whether or not I put in AIs.
                        <br><br>
                        Oh, and please don't look at the 7th character. PLEASE.

                    <p>
                        It is with no small amount of relief that I announce that the worst of the
                        next update is now done. Sprites for another new character are now finished.
                        What's left for this update? Well, I need to make the character functional,
                        which involves finishing up the hitboxes, adding sound effects, doing the
                        animations and transitions, and adding in a few special properties. After
                        that, I'll add that SECRET new level, add music for all the levels, and
                        make the best trailer eva made, which will be posted on this site along
                        with the update blog. I have many more ideas for this game, but they will
                        have to wait for future updates! I'm excited to finish this one up and
                        will probably upload some footage of my friends and I playing alpha
                        version 11. Until next time...

                    <p>
                        WOW I suck at updates lol. I've added a tiny bit of info on the new update.
                        There will be two new levels in addition to a bunch of other things I've
                        been working on. I mentioned a new menu theme last update, but that's being
                        put to the wayside for now (I hadn't made much of the song, anyway). I've
                        been messing with game balance things like gravity and hitstun a lot. I've
                        also made an entirely new level select screen. It's barebones, but it's more
                        usable than the two arrow button system the game used before. I've added
                        a bunch of small things, like a visual effect for invincibility, the number
                        of lives can now be changed, and levels can specifically have kill boundaries
                        at the top that kill you regardless of whether you've been hit. That last
                        one only really affects Sanic Land for now (the ten mile long troll level)
                        because it has spikes at the top. I moved character controls to its own
                        script so I don't have to copy paste the control code for every character.
                        This means that making new characters will be negligably faster since I
                        don't have to paste and edit spaghetti messes of code for each one anymore.
                        More importantly, it will allow me to make AI players that control their
                        characters the same way humans do, effectively. I plan for AI players to
                        be in a future version, like 12 or 13 hopefully. I've also fixed a bunch
                        of bugs, like Sad Sword getting stuck on the back of the Aeroplane when
                        doing his Air Normal kick attack. He also can't camp inside the colliders
                        of levels anymore (though Snowy Summit still needs a little more tweaking).
                        There were also bad problems with the camera being stupid, grab meters not
                        showing or behaving properly, and the game just ending if someone didn't
                        load fast enough. There will be more detail on these fixes and changes when
                        I finally finish this damn update lol. All I can do right now is assure my
                        friends (the only people reading this site other than me) that there is a
                        SECRET sauce in this update that I'm staying tight-lipped about. You shall see...

                        Here's the first development update. I'm not sure how regular these will
                        actually be on account of the fact that this game's development doesn't
                        even occur regularly, but here you go. Development has been on and off,
                        but lately I've made some good progress towards Alpha version 11. The
                        5th character is pretty much complete (unless another sneaky missed
                        detail pops up) and I'm working on some other improvements to the game
                        as well. Just before writing this, I started re-doing the music for the
                        character select screen, and wow does it sound better! Of course, if you
                        haven't played the game, you would have no idea, but it'll sound great,
                        I assure you. Usually, adding a new character would be grounds for me to
                        get all hype and push out the next version so that my friends and I can
                        playtest the new character as soon as possible. This time, however, I
                        will be taking more time than I usually do to work on this version and
                        make it more than an incremental change. For now, details are secret.
                        See you next update.
